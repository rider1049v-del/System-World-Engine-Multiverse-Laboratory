## 1. Characteristics.
Project_000 is a creature that takes the form of a slime, with a dark blue color. It has no eyes or mouth, just a handful of living jelly. Project_000 moves like a snail, very slowly, and even snails move faster than it. But when it comes to eating speed, it has no rivals.
Project_000 has a very unique behavior: it spends every second eating, eating, eating, and eating, continuously without stopping. Project_000 has an extraordinary gluttony, and it's not even known how much its stomach can hold.
Project_000 possesses an energy pattern called Energy Capacity. This energy appears when it lacks food; its body automatically emits this energy as a form of temporary hibernation to stifle its hunger. How does it work? Energy Capacity is an internal energy pattern that functions as a survival mode when Project_000 doesn't get food for a certain period of time. It works in several stages:

A. Energy Reserve Collection.
When Project_000 eats (in any form), a small portion of the material it consumes isn't immediately digested. It is broken down into basic energy, which is stored in its slime core as a reserve. This reserve forms Energy Capacity.

B. Automatic Activation
When Project_000 stops eating or finds no food source, its outer layer detects a decrease in nutrients. At a certain point, Energy Capacity automatically activates without the need for an external trigger.

C. Energy Hibernation Mode
Once activated, the energy in this capacity will:

1. Temporarily inhibit hunger, reducing the "consumption drive" to a minimal level.

2. Slow down bodily functions to a state of near-inactivity.

3. Make the body appear frozen, yet remain alive and stable.
In this phase, Project_000 appears like a static blob of jelly that emits a faint dark blue light—a result of the released energy.

D. Limits and Risks

Energy Capacity does not satiate it. It merely delays the body's collapse due to extreme starvation. If this energy is completely depleted and there is still no food, Project_000 will begin to:

Shrink in size, Lose body viscosity, and eventually undergo meltdown (the body melts and rots).

However, this is extremely rare because his gluttony makes him almost always consume anything around him, even air or oxygen.

====Analysis.====
Friday, December 12, 2025.
Supervisor: Prof. Zella.
We all placed Project_000 in a special isolation room. Because it was too dangerous to approach him, we dropped him from above by opening the gate of his shelter. What we didn't expect was that, as soon as he fell with a loud "SPLATCH!", Project_000 shattered upon landing.
We were shocked and immediately panicked, and didn't know what to do. Is he dead? That's what I thought at the time, but to be sure, I called in some guards in special gray uniforms, with armor on some parts, wearing balaclavas and holding AK-47s. I opened the door to the room and the guards approached him, and his devouring power was no longer active, thus confirming his death.
Just as we were about to shut down the Project, the guards' bodies began to be slowly devoured, their skin disappearing, followed by their nerves, flesh, bones, and finally their souls. We were shocked by the disgusting sight, their screams of pain were audible, but we couldn't do anything, even some researchers vomited at the sight. Project_000 came back to life, on the one hand we were happy, but on the other hand we were terrified. I decided to continue the Project, We put five cows in the room, the cows looked immediately frightened when they saw Project_000, they seemed to see their own death before them. We were all confused and looked at each other, and when we looked back at the room, the cows were gone. Where did they disappear? There was only one answer, Project_000 ate them all in an instant.
It was very strange, Project_000 didn't move from its place, and the cows were quite far from Project_000, I think that was part of Project_000's power can consume anything around it, but the distance is too far for Project_000 to reach. Is it expanding? Or does it have another power that can consume the cows without even getting close? No one knows because none of us witnessed the incident.

After the cows disappeared, we decided to strengthen surveillance of Project_000. I had a team of technicians install thermal cameras, motion cameras, and particle sensors in every corner of the room. However, the results were far from satisfactory. In the initial recordings, Project_000 simply appeared to be a motionless blob of jelly. There was no expansion of its body, no movement, no sign of activity. However, when the particle sensors were rechecked, we discovered something disturbing: the entire room experienced a small but consistent decrease in air mass, as if something were "sucking" the surrounding matter.
At 2:23 PM, one of the researchers, Dr. Arest. It was suggested that Project_000 might be emitting a singular devouring field, a sort of invisible consuming area that silently draws in and engulfs matter within a certain radius. However, this theory remains unconfirmed, as there is no visual or physical evidence to explain how the cows could have been "transferred" into Project_000's body without Project_000 moving. Several hours later, we conducted another test using a two-ton steel ball, dropped from a height of eight meters directly in front of Project_000. The ball landed with a loud thud that echoed throughout the facility. For the first three seconds, nothing happened.
But in the fourth second, the steel ball vibrated, its surface appeared to have been eaten away, and in less than a blink of an eye, it was gone. Completely gone. There was no trace, no dust, no heat left on the floor where it had been. Even the heat sensors detected no change. It was as if the ball had never existed.
When we zoomed in on the video footage at 1200% zoom and used a low-frequency filter, we detected something resembling a slight spatial distortion around Project_000. The distortion appeared just half a second before the steel ball disappeared.
It was the strongest evidence yet that Project_000 wasn't just consuming matter through physical contact; it was consuming existence itself.

At this point, Professor Margaret issued a preliminary recommendation:
“Project_000 is no longer categorized as a normal physical being. There are indications of non-linear capabilities that allow for the consumption of matter without direct interaction.”

But before the recommendation could be signed, something else happened.
At 4:11 PM, the isolation room suddenly heard a low rumbling sound, like the deep breathing of something very large. The lights flickered, and the particle sensors detected a drastic decrease in air mass, more than 35% in two seconds. We all panicked and ran to the observation room, expecting Project_000 to explode or undergo a change in form.
But when we arrived, what we saw froze everyone:
Project_000 was expanding.
Not much—just a few centimeters taller. But it was enough to confirm one thing:
He grew every time he ate something, no matter how big or small. And the most terrifying thing was, as his body grew even slightly, a faint echo echoed throughout the room, the same sound as when the guards were eaten—a muffled scream, mixed with a "SLRRTCH" sound like flesh being ripped apart from the inside.
The three researchers immediately recoiled in fear. One of them fainted.

I noted one crucial thing we hadn't expected:
Project_000 wasn't just eating the bodies of living creatures, it was eating their "traces of existence." Including their last voices. Including their pain. Including their life energy. And all of it was stored inside him.
